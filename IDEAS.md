# Metal Detector
## Summary: 

Metal detection can be done in a variety of different ways. Here we will outline two basic methods for metal detection. Both methods rely on the modification of the inductance of a circuit in the presences of a metallic object.  Both detection scenarios rely on the fact that conducting materials have a diamagnetic response in the presence of an AC magnetic field.  This 
diamagnetic response will lower the effective inductance of any coil that is near the metallic object.  This turns out to be true even for ferromagnetic conductors like iron as the diamagnetic response is higher for most frequencies.   

## Method 1 — Mutual Inductance 

This method is perhaps the more primitive of the two.  Two coils, a source coil and a detection coil, are placed close to one another (like the primary and secondary coils of a transformer).  The source coil is driven with a voltage of some predetermined frequency.  The optimal frequency depends on the physical attributes of the coil but is not terribly important.  An emf in induced in the detection coil.  Care should be taken that the diameter of the detection coil is less than or equal to the diameter of the source coil.  As the mutual induction goes down in the presence of a metallic object so will the amplitude of the emf product on the detection coil.  This amplitude change can easily be visualized by converting the output AC signal to DC using a rectifier bridge and a low pass filter.  Once the output has been converted to DC the signal can be fed into a comparator with an adjustable threshold and displayed with an LED. 

## Method 2 — Self Inductance 

This method requires only one coil and relies on the fact that the self-inductance of a coil will diminish in the presence of a metallic object.  If the inductance of the coil is made to be part of an oscillator circuit then the oscillation frequency will change in the presence of a metal.  If the output of oscillator is fed into a frequency to voltage converter as shown we can again use a comparator and LED to flag the presence of a metal.  Alternatively, the oscillator output can be used to drive a speaker such that the tone of the sound is proportional to the size and/or location of the metallic object. We found that by measuring the frequency with a microcontroller that this method was sensitive enough to distinguish between common US coins. 

## Conclusion 

Measuring the effectiveness a project based class for electromagnetics is not an easy task.  We implemented a traditional method for measuring effectiveness by giving exit surveys.  On average, students were more positive about the projects than lectures and homework.  We feel this does not truly measure the effectiveness of the projects.  As such, we also selected small groups of volunteers to take short periodic competency exams.  These exams are designed to measure how well students can apply core concepts from the course.  The oral exams always show a dramatic improvement shortly after the completion of a project.  We feel this is more persuasive evidence that the project based course is a more effective learning tool than a traditional lecture course.
