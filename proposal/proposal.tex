\section{INTRODUCTION}
In this term project, the aim is to build a system that demonstrates the fundamental concepts that are covered in the course EEE-351. For this purpose, a literature review is conducted, in order to come up with a suitable project proposal. In this process, we came across with the topic electromagnetic suspension, which fascinated us as a group. Even though the concept is applicable to various systems from Maglev trains to Spaceship Launchers, we gravitate to implementation of the system as a car suspension. Electromagnetic suspension is a system that ``provides both additional stability and maneuverability by performing active roll and pitch control during cornering and braking, as well as eliminating road irregularities, hence increasing both vehicle and passenger safety and drive comfort''~\autocite{active_suspension}.

However, this system manages to achieve this task by constantly altering the strength of a magnetic field via earnest feedback loop, which is too complex just to demonstrate basic electromagnetics concepts. Thus, we decided to implement the given system with a passive control mechanism, i.e., using two repelling magnets placed in a short pipe (see Fig.~\ref{fig:suspension}). In addition, we decided to implement a circuitry that can adjust the default height of the car; via passing constant current through the coil that surrounds the aforementioned pipe, which simulates the suspension of the car. Since the Biot-Savart law suggests that a constant current through a wire generates a magnetic field, the specified design will be able to alter the existing magnetic field to change the distance between the two magnets in the suspension pipe~\autocite{emt_textbook}.

\section{PROJECT DESCRIPTION}
Electromagnetic car suspension system with repulsive magnets as damping element, along with default height adjustment.    

\section{WORK PLAN}
Firstly we calculated the magnetic flux density that we can obtain by flowing current through a solenoid and the resulting attraction and repulsion force when we put this solenoid in an external magnetic field caused by permanent magnets. Once calculations showed that we can obtain enough force for our purposes, we made an experiment to see if our calculations are realistic and we observe that they are agreed each other. After being convinced that we can hold our test car on the air along syringe axis by only magnetic force we are planning to make use of permanent magnets as a passive suspensions and we will try to change its height by applying additional magnetic field by flowing current through solenoid as depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:suspension}. Finally, we are planning to control all these things such as changing the height of all four wheels independently from each other with a microcontroller via bluetooth.
